# ðŸ§ª Homelab

This repository contains my personal homelab setup: it's a collection of projects and configurations focused on **DevOps** and **SRE** practices.

Each folder documents a real setup: from system configurations and network setup to service automation and monitoring tools. Everything is tested on physical hardware or virtualized environments.
