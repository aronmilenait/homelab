# 💻 About this project

I installed **Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS (64-bit)** on an old laptop I had lying around. I wanted to give it a third life: it previously ran Lubuntu (Ubuntu + LXDE) before I formatted it and replaced it with a server-oriented OS.

## 🕰️ A little bit of backstory

This laptop has been with me for over nine years. It went through countless Linux distributions over time: Manjaro, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, ArcoLinux, and so many others.

When I was a teenager, this was my playground for exploring Linux. I learned a lot from configuring and troubleshooting. It was a great learning experience.

After upgrading to a better laptop in 2022, I left this one running Lubuntu but barely touched it again. Now, it's back in action, repurposed as the first physical device in my homelab.
