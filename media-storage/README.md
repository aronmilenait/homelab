# :floppy_disk: MediaStorage

## :speech_balloon: About this project
**MediaStorage** is a project I'm building to practice many technologies that I find interesting, that will be mentioned in the section below. 

It's currently running on my laptop, which runs Fedora, but once the first version is finished I will have it in a server. 

## :hammer: Technologies used:
- **LocalStack** to emulate S3 from AWS
- **Docker** for containerized environment
- **Python** for automation scripts
- **Bash** for setup and configuration scripts
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for observability and monitoring
- **Makefile** for task automation
